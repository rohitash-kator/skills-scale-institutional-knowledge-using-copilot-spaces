## Why This Matters

Changes are inevitable, but unmanaged change leads to confusion, rework, and misalignment. This checklist ensures:
- **Transparency**: All stakeholders understand what's changing and why
- **Risk mitigation**: Impact is assessed before committing to change
- **Accountability**: Clear approvals and ownership
- **Traceability**: Documentation stays current, reducing future confusion
- **Continuous improvement**: Lessons from changes inform better decision-making

Use this checklist to maintain control while staying adaptable.
